# Destinova Travel Map UI

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview

**Destinova Travel Map UI** is the front-end user interface component for visualizing travel destinations, routes, and points of interest on an interactive map. This project is designed to provide users with a clean, responsive, and engaging experience for planning and tracking their journeys.

It serves as the main visual interface, allowing users to interact with map data, filter destinations, and view detailed trip information.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Map Display:** Powered by a modern mapping library (e.g., Leaflet or Mapbox) for smooth navigation.
* **Destination Markers:** Clear visual markers for key locations, cities, or travel hubs.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop and mobile devices.
* **Search & Filtering:** Functionality to search for specific locations and filter destinations by criteria (e.g., category, budget, or popularity).
* **Route Visualization:** Ability to draw and display optimized travel routes between multiple points.
* **Detailed Popups/Tooltips:** Information windows that display essential data (images, descriptions, links) upon clicking a map marker.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

Based on the nature of a modern travel map interface, the following technologies are likely used or are excellent candidates for this project:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5 / CSS3** | Structure and basic styling of the application. |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Core interactivity and logic. |
| **Map Library** | **(e.g., Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS)** for rendering and handling map data. |
| **(Possible Framework)** | **(e.g., React, Vue, or Vanilla JS)** for component-based architecture and state management. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Node.js & npm (or Yarn):** Required if the project uses a modern JavaScript framework (like React or Vue) or relies on front-end build tools.
* **Web Browser:** A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to view the application.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Htet-2aung/destinova-travel-map-ui.git](https://github.com/Htet-2aung/destinova-travel-map-ui.git)
    cd destinova-travel-map-ui
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (if applicable):**

    *If the project contains a `package.json` file (common for framework-based projects), run:*

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project

The steps to run the project depend on its architecture:

#### Option 1: Static HTML/CSS/JS

If the project is a simple UI without a framework build step:

1.  Navigate to the project's root folder.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

    ```bash
    open index.html # On macOS
    # Or manually drag and drop the file into your browser
    ```

#### Option 2: Framework-based (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue)

If you installed dependencies via `npm` or `yarn`:

1.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```

2.  The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port).
